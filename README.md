# Dr.Racket Spaceship Game
Fly a spaceship through a cave!

**Intro:**
Welcome to my first program (that isn't just coding homework assignments).

This was built from scratch using concepts I learned in my first computer science course at UBC (CPSC 110) which uses the Racket language. 
Key concepts utilized include: representing an object with changing position and speed variables; generating and filtering lists; collision detection; managing keyboard inputs, and displaying changing information (distance, level info, etc.).

**To play the game:**
- Open the "Spaceship Game.rkt" in Dr. Racket
- Run the program and execute "(main G1)" in the interactions window
- Once the game has started, use the up and down arrow keys to control your ship. Don't touch the walls of the cave!
- Difficulty gradually increases over 4 levels. Each new level results in the cave getting narrower and harder to navigate.

Some screenshots are below including the start of the game, part way though the game, collision, and game completion.
