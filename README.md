# Dr.Racket Spaceship Game
Fly a spaceship through a cave!

## Intro: 
Welcome to my first program (that isn't just coding homework assignments).

This was built from scratch using concepts I learned in my first computer science course at UBC (CPSC 110) which uses the Racket language. 
Key concepts utilized include: representing an object with changing position and speed variables; generating and filtering lists; collision detection; managing keyboard inputs, and displaying changing information (distance, level info, etc.).

## To play the game:
- Open the "Spaceship Game.rkt" in Dr. Racket
- Run the program and execute "(main G1)" in the interactions window
- Once the game has started, use the up and down arrow keys to control your ship. Don't touch the walls of the cave!
- Difficulty gradually increases over 4 levels. Each new level results in the cave getting narrower and harder to navigate.
- The game is over once you reach the end of level 4.

## Images:  
Some screenshots are included below including playing the game, colliding with the cave, and completing thegame.
